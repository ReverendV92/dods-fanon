* Thanks to:
http://khed.glsl.ru/ for the great 3D modeling tool: kHED
http://www.gimp.org/ for the separated windows which driving me crazy
http://www.cgtextures.com/ for the textures collection

http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Main_Page for the comprehensive list
http://www.interlopers.net/ for the good tutorials

* Note that some models using HL2 textures directly from GCF files (models which coming with VMT files without their VTF counterpart)
If you want to use those models somewhere else than Source games, first you will have to create you own textures -.-



   enjoy :)
