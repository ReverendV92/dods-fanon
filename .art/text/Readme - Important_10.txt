Models & Skins by Kathar (Marc Hales)


---GMod9 Installation---

Copy the 'materials', 'models' and any other folders that are included in this zip to: "...SteamApps\SourceMods\gmod\"
For eg. "C:\Program Files\Valve\Steam\SteamApps\SourceMods\gmod\"


Now, add these lines-:

	"Syringe Empty"				"models/katharsmodels/syringe_in/syringe_in.mdl"
	"Syringe Full"				"models/katharsmodels/syringe_out/syringe_out.mdl"

-to whichever spawn menu you like.
For eg. "C:\Program Files\Valve\Steam\SteamApps\SourceMods\gmod\settings\menu_props\random_crap.txt"
Make sure you add the lines after the '{' symbol, but before the '}'.



---Retail GMod (10) Installation---

Copy the "materials", "models" and any other folders, that are included in this zip, to: "...SteamApps\(UsernameHere)\garrysmod\garrysmod\"
For eg. "C:\Program Files\Valve\Steam\SteamApps\steam_user123\garrysmod\garrysmod\"

Now, load up GMod (10) and open up the 'Q' menu. On the left, you will see a folder/file icon. Click it.
You now double-click on the "Root" button. And then, double-click "garrysmod", followed by "katharsmodels".
From there, enter any sub-folder you fancy, right-click on any '.mdl' file and add it to whichever spawn menu you like.



---Terms & Conditions---

1.) Reskinning of these models is allowed, so long as it "clearly" states I created these models.

2.) Do not release these models claiming that you created them.

3.) No need to ask to stick these models into model packs, as i would happy if someone even wanted to.
